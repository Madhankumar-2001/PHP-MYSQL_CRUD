# PHP-MYSQL_CRUD
I used PHP_MYSQL to do simple CRUD operations for this project.
The -> read.php, update.php, update_form.html, view.php, view_form.html, delete.php, delete_form.html, crud_example.sql, images.png, create.php, create_form.html These files are kept in their own folder. 

I run the main.html page that I worked on in a different folder. I also included one picture.
